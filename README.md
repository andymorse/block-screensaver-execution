# Block Screensaver Execution
I have been seeing more and more session cookie stealing malware coming through via a .scr files. This is a test script that changes windows to open the SCR file to notepad instead of executing. I have not been able to 100% verify the scr does not execute as well, but I believe this is a good first step. 


Please don't hesitate to comment if there are any better methods to block these files to executing.
